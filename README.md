# Brain Tumer Segmentation - UNet
Developed an AI model (U-Net) to automatically detect and outline brain tumors in MRI scans, enhancing the accuracy of tumor boundary identification. Tested different technical approaches and performance measures across various MRI data types (T1, T1CE, T2, FLAIR) to determine the most effective configuration for diverse tissue types.
